I'm Cl√©o, a 22yo French developper!

My main languages are [Go](https://go.dev/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)! Sometimes I use Java for minecraft [plugins](https://github.com/constantoine/tombstone), to remind me not to take on Java jobs.

Working in Edtech and Fintech the day, and working on personnal projects (some of which I even finished!) at night. [totp-rs](https://github.com/constantoine/totp-rs) is one of those projects of which I'm proud.

### Languages I can code in:
- Go
- Rust
- C
- Python
- Java
